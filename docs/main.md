# Zenith documentation

Just to note, this documentation is about the *language and its environment*, not about the 
*compiler*, the latter's documentation can be found running `doxygen` on the project root and 
going to `doxydocs/index.html`.

Another note, because the language is still in its early phases, this documentation will lack some features, and also denote ones that will be or are being worked on.

The documentation assumes that you have never seen a programming language in your entire life, but it 
gets progressively harder as soon as the basic syntax is fully covered.

but it does assumes you have at least some knownledge on the following topics:

- Math:
    - Base 2 (binary), Base 10 (decimal), Base 16 (hexadecimal)
    - Functions 
    - Sets (just the very basic) 
- Computing:
    - Memory layout 
    - Endianness
