# Zenith docs: `syntax/functions`

Functions, on a functional language, quite expected right? Anyways, functions have a simple 
syntax (for now), and it is 

```zenith

# function without arguments

function_name => expression

# function with arguments

function_name(arg1, ... , argN) => expression

```
