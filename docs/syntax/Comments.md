# Zenith docs -> `syntax/comments`

Comments are awesome! They are responsible for anyone reading your code to understand what is
actually happening, if you are not used with programming, I can say that it happens a lot of the
time.

The syntax for comments is really easy, just add a `#` on a blank line or the end of a line and 
there you have it

```zenith
# this is a comment, you can write in your normal language, because
# the compiler should just ignore whatever is after the hashtag

some_constant = 2 # and you also can put it after a code like
```
