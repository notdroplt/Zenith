## Zenith syntax documentation: comments

Comments are serve no compiler purpose, but they do have one for who is going to read the code after
it has already been written. 

---

To make a comment, it is 
there you have it

```zenith
// this is a comment, you can write in your normal language, because
// the compiler should just ignore whatever is after the hashtag

some_constant = 2 // and you also can put it after a code like this
```
