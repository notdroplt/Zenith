# Supernova Instruction Set

A reduced instruction set designed to be the first compiler target,
opcodes and behaviors might change in future releases.

## Instruction Layouts

This table defines how are the instruction types laid out, bit by bit,
with the most significant bit first.

R type instructions (R standing for register) are instructions that
use 3 registers and normally operate as `rd <- r1 â—‹ r2`, as `r1`
referring to the first argument (and not register r01) and r2
referring to the second argument (and not register r02). Register
`rd` is the destination register, nothing stops `rd` to be `r1` or
`r2`

## interrupts

### default interrupts/exceptions used by the virtual machine

- `pcall -1`: [Processor interface](#pcall--1)
- `pcall 0`: Divison by zero
- `pcall 1`: General fault
- `pcall 2`: Double fault
- `pcall 3`: Triple fault
- `pcall 4`: Invalid instruction
- `pcall 5`: Page fault
- `pcall 6`: Invalid IO

everything after this is programmable (in theory), but some different
implementations might use other values

#### `pcall 0`: Division by zero

As the name suggests, this program call is triggered every time there is
a division by zero on the program. A compiler can simply put a divide by zero
instruction on a program and call it a breakpoint

#### `pcall 1`: General Fault

General faults occur by any kind of unhandled exception the processor is not
able to detect or recognize

#### `pcall 2`: Double Fault

A double fault occurs when any interrupt is called/triggered by a general fault

#### `pcall 3`: Triple Fault

A triple fault is one of the fatal faults inside the processor.
Causing it possibly triggers hardware functions for resetting

## `pcall -1`

Only `pcall -1` is hardware/vm defined, all the other $2^{51}-1$ possible interrupts are programmable with a call to `pcall -1`:

The interface defines `r29:r28` as the interrupt space and functionality switches, while other registers are used accordingly as each function needs.
Normally, `r28 = 0` will be a `r29` implementation check, behaving as a `xorr r31, r31` in case `r29`'s feature is not implmemented.

**`pcall -1` functions**

- `r29 = 0`: [interrupt vector functions](#interrupt-vector-interrupt-space)
- - `r28 = 0`: [interrupt vector check](#interrupt-vector-check)
- - `r28 = 1`: [interrupt vector enable](#interrupt-vector-enable)
- `r29 = 1`: [paging functions](#paging-interrupt-space)
- - `r28 = 0`: [paging check](#paging-check)
- - `r28 = 1`: [paging enable](#paging-enable)
- `r29 = 2`: [model information](#model-information-interrupt-space)
- - `r28 = 0`: [model check](#model-check)
- - `r28 = 1`: []
- `r29 = 3`: [hyper functions](#hyper-function-interrupt-space)
- - `r28

### interrupt vector interrupt space

#### interrupt vector check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r31`: `0` if no interrupts are possible, `pcall 0:0` is just a shadow to `add r31, r0, r0`,  
         `1` if interrupts are possible, but only in the address specified by `r29`,  
         `2` if interrupts are possible anywhere defined by the program,  

- `r30`: in case `r31 != 0`, defines the amount of interrupts the processor is able to handle

- `r29`: in case `r31 == 1`, sets bit flags to which hardware interrupts are supported

trashed registers: none

#### interrupt vector enable

input registers:

- `r31` (possibly): in case where `pcall 0:0` returned `2`, set the interrupt vector register to the specified pointer, else value is just ignored

output registers: none

trashed registers: none

---

### paging interrupt space

#### paging check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r31`: set to the processor's amount of page level reach, can assume either `0` or `â‰¥ 2`
- `r30`: in case `r31` is not zero, returns the processor's page size

trashed registers: none

#### paging enable

input registers:

- `r30`:

#### `r28 = 1`, `r30 = page root directory`

Enable paging, with `r30` set to the memory location of the first page root directory location

---

### model information interrupt space

#### information check

input registers: none

output registers:

- `r31`: set if the processor is able to give more information about itself

trashed registers: none
