 * \mainpage Zenith language
 * \section Introduction
 * 
 * Zenith is a functional-like language, developed by me alone as a project using [scientific methods](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/2110821-fuck-around-and-find-out),
 * to achieve some math with programming, and also use only a single programming language instead of many. 
 *
 * Even with the code as robust as it is, as cited in the code's license, there is no warranty that it will work as intended for now, 
 * but I hope in the long term it is at least stable.
 * 
 * The development of the language, even though it is from an entirely different paradigm, is
 * heavily inspired by [this BASIC interpreter](https://github.com/davidcallanan/py-myopl-code) [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg&list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97yD)

 *
 * Remember, this is a "vacation" project (as these last 3 years kinda were vacation), I have no idea if i will continue developing it while on high school specially 
 * 
 * \section reason Why did I make this
 * In short, no reason at all. but it was either this or descent into madness during 3 years where i was inside home.
 * **by the way** naming it was a very hard task because naming things is [actually one of the hardest things in programming]
 *
 *
 * \section Syntax Zenith Syntax
 * Zenith will look like, most of the time, as your normal functional language, with functions being the center of everything
